This is the response to a challlenge by xelantro who said that minecraft mods cannot invoke a shell script.

After I got the shell working, I also intend to include the possibility to take complex calculations to the host system, as well as 
making the possible calculations easily expandable.

<h3>Instructions</h3>
1. Start MemiumServer.py (or your own Server implementation)
2. Start client on your OC system
3. On the client, type *extshell* followed by the shell command that you want the server system to execute.
4. QED, Xelantro
